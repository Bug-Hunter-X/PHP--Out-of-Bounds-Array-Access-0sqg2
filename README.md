# PHP Array Out-of-Bounds Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: accessing an array element using an index that's outside the valid range. This often leads to an `Undefined offset` notice, potentially causing unexpected program behavior or crashes.  The solution shows how to prevent this error by always validating array indexes before accessing elements.
